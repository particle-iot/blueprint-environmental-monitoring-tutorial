  This Environmental Monitoring Tutorial demonstrates how to use the Seeed Studio Grove Temperature & Humidity Sensor with a Particle device to measure and publish temperature and humidity data to the cloud. The cloud converts Celsius readings to Fahrenheit, stores data in Ledger, and triggers alerts based on user-defined temperature thresholds.
